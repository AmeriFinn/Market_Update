# Weekly_Market_Report
The python scripts and jupyter notebooks I use to create and publish a weekly report on US markets

- The `Weekly Market Report.ipynb` file is how I actually create the visual and publish it to DataPane. I'm going to convert this file to a .py file and clean up the script to inlcude relevant classes, methods, and attributes. 
- With the `my_weekly_articles.py` script, I still need to work on the class that will *score* the list of articles, and also create the class for generating a weekly written summary based on the content of the articles.
